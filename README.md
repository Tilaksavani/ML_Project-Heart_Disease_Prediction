# ML_Project - Heart_Disease_Prediction

This project utilizes logistic regression to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on various health-related factors.

### Project Overview

Heart disease is a leading cause of death globally. Early detection and risk assessment are crucial for prevention and treatment. This project leverages logistic regression, a machine learning model, to analyze patient data and predict the probability of developing heart disease. 

###  Data

The project typically uses a dataset containing patient information like age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, blood sugar etc. The dataset also includes a target variable indicating the presence or absence of heart disease.

###  Logistic Regression for Heart Disease Prediction

Logistic regression is a well-suited model for this task as it excels in binary classification problems like predicting the presence or absence of heart disease. The model analyzes the patient data and calculates the probability of an individual belonging to the "heart disease" class or the "healthy" class based on the provided features.

###  Running the Project

The main script (`main.py` or similar) typically follows these steps:

1. **Load the data:** Load the heart disease dataset using appropriate libraries.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and prepare the data for modeling. This might involve handling missing values, scaling numerical features, and potentially encoding categorical features (if present).
3. **Split Data:** Divide the data into training and testing sets. The training set is used to train the logistic regression model, and the testing set evaluates its performance on unseen data.
4. **Model Training:** Train the logistic regression model on the training data. 
5. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the model's performance on the testing set using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. 
6. **(Optional) Model Saving:**  Save the trained model for future use.

###  Additional Notes

* This project showcases logistic regression for heart disease prediction. You can explore other machine learning models and hyperparameter tuning for potentially better results. 
* Consider data visualization techniques to understand the relationships between health factors and heart disease risk.
* Feel free to modify the code to experiment with different functionalities, like making predictions for new patient data.
